Many works related to software engineering rely upon for- mal models, e.g.,
to perform model-checking or automatic test case generation. Nonetheless,
producing such mod- els is usually tedious and error-prone. Model inference
is a research field helping in producing models by generating partial models
from documentation or execution traces (ob- served action sequences). This
paper presents a new model generation method combining model inference and
expert systems. It appears that an engineer is able to recognise the functional
behaviours of an application from its traces by applying deduction rules. We
propose a framework, applied to Web applications, simulating this reasoning
mechanism, with inference rules organised into layers. Each yields partial
IOSTSs (Input Output Symbolic Transition Systems), which become more and more
abstract and understandable.
